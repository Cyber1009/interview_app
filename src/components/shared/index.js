/**
 * Shared Components Export File
 * 
 * This file exports all shared components to make imports cleaner throughout the application.
 * Instead of importing directly from individual files, components can be imported from this central export.
 * 
 * Example:
 * import { ConfigManager, FormattedDate, StatusBadge } from 'components/shared';
 */

// Configuration Related
export { default as ConfigManager } from './ConfigManager';

// Add other shared component exports here as they are created
// export { default as FormattedDate } from './FormattedDate';
// export { default as StatusBadge } from './StatusBadge';
// etc.
